# Lacrosse-Database
Took real names, but fake data in order to create a database to run queries on. 

Created own data from scratch using Mac Commonwealth lacrosse teams. 
Put data into a Google spreadsheet. Used concatenation, Random number generators, 
and many more functions in order to create other fake data in order for the database to be substantial.
This fake data included the student's name, team, parents, NIL deal, and even what lifts they had during the week. 

Created ER diagram and Relationship Schema on LucidChart. 

Created DDL by hand, using the relational schema. 

Used the Google sheet in order to create the insert statements in a resourceful manner. 

Created ways to interact with the database once all parts were put into MySQL. 

After all of the setup was in place, was able to use Jupyter to create the application code.
With some set up, anyone with the Jupyter code could interact with the database.
